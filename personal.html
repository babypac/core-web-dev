		<h2>Experience</h2>
		<p>
			I started my career as a software engineer. Then I got interested in education because I felt it was the most productive among any other fields. Then I decided to be an educator for my whole life. Now I have been designing instruction and instructing students for more than 8 years. I am very skillful at creating a good learning experience for students. Now I am running Nuts & Bolts, the company providing e-Learning contents.
